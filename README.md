### Tuts+ Course: Node for the Front-End Developer
#### Instructor: Jason Rhodes

In this course, you'll learn how to use your knowledge of client-side JavaScript to help you master the basics of Node.js, as well as the many front-end development workflow tools written in node. We'll spend some time getting comfortable with the command line, understanding what Node.js is and how it differs from client-side JS, and then walk through the tools and libraries that can significantly improve your life as a front-end developer.
